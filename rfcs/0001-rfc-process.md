# RFC 0001: RFC process

- Type: Procedural
- Status: Draft
- Created: 2026-11-12
- Author: Codex

## Summary

Record significant public contract changes as numbered RFCs before implementation.

## Motivation

Onni needs a stable place to specify public behavior and link implementation evidence.

## Guide-level explanation

Claim `rfcs/ids/NNNN` with the document's kebab-case slug, copy
`rfcs/0000-template.md`, and write `rfcs/NNNN-slug.md`. Describe the design,
alternatives, effects, and unresolved questions. Implementation changes cite the RFC.

## Reference-level explanation

Identifiers are sequential and stay assigned after retirement. Required header
fields are Type, Status, Created, and Author. Required sections are Summary,
Motivation, Guide-level explanation, and Unresolved questions. Product RFCs also
specify reference behavior, drawbacks, rationale and alternatives, and prior art.

Types are Standards Track, Informational, Historical, and Procedural. Statuses are
Draft, Experimental, Proposed, Stable, Final, Deferred, Rejected, Superseded, and
Obsolete. Proposed changes use a two-week review period. A maintainer records
acceptance as Stable; shipped behavior can be specified as Stable immediately.
Final marks a deployed contract whose breaking changes need another RFC.

Keep documents below 150 lines when one concern fits. Repository paths are allowed.
Skip RFCs for bug fixes, typos, and refactors that preserve public contracts.

## Unresolved questions

Maintainers have not yet confirmed this process draft for ongoing project use.
